The folder **SimRes_ests_converge_check** contains the results of parameter estimates at 5 different level of measurement errors. 

The .R file **Gradients averaged over time and data sets** generates the spatial/temporal gradients averaged over time and data sets, then record them in the corresponding .txt files.
