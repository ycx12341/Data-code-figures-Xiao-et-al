## Averaged gradients ##

The folder **SimRes_ests_converge_check** contains the results of parameter estimates at 5 different level of measurement errors. 

The .R file **Gradients averaged over time and data sets** generates the spatial/temporal gradients averaged over time and data sets, then record them in the corresponding .txt files. 

The .m file **Gradient_plots** plots the averaged spatial/temporal gradients based on the .txt files generated previously.
