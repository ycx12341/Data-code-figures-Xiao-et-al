## Gradient plots ##

This folder contains the gradient plots. The first folder **Averaged gradients** contains the plots of gradients averaged over time and 200 perturbed datasets, the second folder **Explicit gradients** contains the explicit gradients evaluated at each integer timepoint, which were only averaged over 200 perturbed datasets.
