## Results without measurement errors ##

This folder contains the parameter estimates and the corresponding gradients predicted by GAM without measurement errors, which were written in **Reference gradients GAM.txt** and **Reference gradients GAM.rds**.

The .R file **True gradients from numerical scheme** calculates the true gradients using the finite difference scheme used to solve the PDE system, the results were written in **True gradients forward difference scheme.txt**.
