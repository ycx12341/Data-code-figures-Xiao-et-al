## Results without measurement errors ##

This folder contains the parameter estimates and the corresponding gradients predicted by GAM without measurement errors, which were generated by the .R files **PDE_GradientMatching_Functions.R** and **PDE_GradientMatching_NoMeasurementError.R**, written in **Reference gradients GAM.txt** and **Reference gradients GAM.rds**.

The .R file **True gradients from numerical scheme.R** calculates the true gradients using the finite difference scheme used to solve the PDE system, the results were written in **True gradients forward difference scheme.txt**.
